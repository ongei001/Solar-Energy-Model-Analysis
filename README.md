# Solar-Energy-Model-Analysis
This analysis aims to evaluate the potential benefits of installing a battery storage system alongside existing solar panels for a residential property. Weâ€™ll be analyzing data from 2020 to determine electricity usage patterns, solar generation, and potential cost savings.


### Project Overview
- **Objective:** To evaluate the financial and operational benefits of adding a battery storage system to an existing solar energy setup.
- **Scope:** Analysis includes cost savings, battery performance, long-term financial viability, and environmental impact based on data from 2020.

### Key Findings
1. **Solar Generation vs. Electricity Usage:**
   - Solar generation peaks between 10 AM and 2 PM.
   - Electricity usage peaks in the evening.

2. **Potential Savings:**
   - Battery installation would have saved $16,752.22 in 2020.

3. **Battery Performance:**
   - The 12.5 kWh battery stored excess solar energy and reduced grid reliance.
   - Monthly visualizations show a reduction in purchased electricity.

4. **Long-term Financial Analysis:**
   - **Government Scenario (4% annual increase):**
     - NPV: $5,451.32
     - IRR: 14.13%
   - **Naomi's Scenario (4% + 0.25% annual increase):**
     - NPV: $9,312.72
     - IRR: 16.80%

### Implications
1. **Financial Viability:**
   - The battery investment is financially viable, with a more favorable outlook in scenarios with higher electricity price increases.

2. **Energy Independence:**
   - The system reduces grid dependence and provides a buffer against future price increases.

3. **Environmental Impact:**
   - Increased solar energy utilization and reduced grid reliance contribute to a lower carbon footprint.

### Recommendations
1. Proceed with the battery system installation.
2. Monitor performance post-installation.
3. Consider expanding the solar panel system if electricity prices rise faster than anticipated.

### Limitations and Further Study
1. **Limitations:**
   - Analysis based on 2020 data, which may not account for long-term trends.
   - Assumes consistent electricity price increases.

2. **Further Study:**
   - Analyze data over multiple years.
   - Conduct sensitivity analysis with different electricity price scenarios.

### Conclusion
Installing the battery storage system is financially advantageous, offers substantial cost savings, increases energy independence, and supports environmental sustainability.
